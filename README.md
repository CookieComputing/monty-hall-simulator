# monty-hall-simulator
A Scala-based simulation of the Monty Hall problem

## What is this project?
A while ago, I really struggled to understand the concept of the Monty Hall
problem, and found myself unconvinced that there were unequal probabilities.
Nevertheless, I wanted to add a simulation of the problem to convince myself
of the solution to the problem.
